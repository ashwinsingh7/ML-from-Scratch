# ML-from-Scratch

To get a deeper and more nuanced understanding of ML, I endeavour to thoroughly understand (and as far as possible, derive) the math and statistics underlying different ML algorithms and then implement them in Python with minimal use of high-level ML libraries. This approach aligns with Richard Feynman’s principle: *“What I cannot create, I do not understand.”*

Hope to get started with this project soon!
